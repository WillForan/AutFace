# Autism Faces
Functional MR collected from 2011-2014 with participant preforming EPrime tasks.


## TODO
* datalad
* `bids.py` - confirm `sdim4` uniquely IDs which task (USA, AUS, CARS, rest)
  * json side card is where?
  * see https://nipype.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/generated/nipype.interfaces.dcm2nii.html
* compare generated mrid<->id pairs to previous iterations
* extract event timing from eprime log files
* preprocess
* deconvolve/PPI
