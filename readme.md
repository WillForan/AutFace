# Autism Faces
Functional MR collected from 2011-2014. Includes 3 sets (aus faces, usa faces, cars) of 2 (mem, recall) EPrime tasks.
Two matched groups: ASD and TD.

[`Makefile`](./Makefile) outlines the full pipeline

## Data TX
Imaging and task data is on box.
See [`retrive_box`](retrive_box) using [rclone](https://rclone.org/box/). [`99_boxsync.bash`](99_boxsync.bash) was used to upload.

The disk usage for just the final output of preprocessing is about **115 Gb**. `124 visits * 155 Mb * 6 scans.` 

The entire preprocessing pipeline -- useful for QA, rerunning, and auditing -- is ~1Tb (`124*6*1.3G`).

## Preprocessing
* `01_bids`                 - raw dcm to BIDS standard
* `021_proc_t1` + `02_proc` - [`lncdprep`](https://github.com/LabNeuroCogDevel/fmri_processing_scripts) preprocessing

### Bold

`nfaswdktm_func_6.nii.gz` is the per run MNI space T2\* image output of preprocesing.
See [`fmri_processing_Scripts`](https://github.com/LabNeuroCogDevel/fmri_processing_scripts).

The file prefix has can be read as the preprocessing steps right to left:
* `tm` - 4d slice motion
* `k` - skull strip
* `d` - wavelet despiking
* `w` - warp to mni
* `s` - susan smoothing with 6mm kernal
* `a` - `ica_aroma`
* `f` - highpass filter
* `n` - normalized timeseries to `10000/globalmedian`

Shown here with `9s Mem` event stimulus for reference (see "Timing" for more on that).

### Motion
`mt` 4dslice+motion alignment computes trans and rot motion paramaters in `motion.par` a la fsl's mcflirt. Framewise displacement is also calculated. GLM censors `fd > .8` ([`motion_info.R`](motion_info.R)).

see in e.g. `../preproc/aus/102/ses-1/sub-102_ses-1_task-AUS_run-1_bold/` `motion.par` and `motion_info/*png`.

1dplot -sepscl motion.par
```

### QA

* [`qa`](qa) - script to collect and view qa collections
* warping: inspecting all T1<->MNI linear warps as a time series -- point per visit. Okay? But 2 large ventricles participants. 
  - looking for bad skullstrip or misaligned warp.

## Task

### Timing
Task timing were extracted from eprime txt log files and are save as long (line/row per event) CSVs. See `mkonsets_{mem,recall}.R` on top of `tasklog` (also [`eplog`](https://github.com/LabNeuroCogDevel/lncdtools)).

* [`txt/onsets_mem.csv`](txt/onset_mem.csv) -- `"year","id","task","tasktime","repnum","event","ACC","dur","RT","onset"`
* [`txt/onsets_recall.csv`](txt/onset_recall.csv) -- `"year","id","task","tasktime","trial","onset","event","FixTime","TestSlide","TestSlide.RT","CorrectResp","TestSlide.ACC"`

The scripts `mktime_mr` and `mktime_task` are used by `merge_times.R` to match MR and Eprime run order.

### memory

![timeline](img/AUS_eprime_timeline_screenshot.png)

3 Stimulus perspectives are shown for each object. The order is always the same.
For `AUS` and `CMFT (USA)`, the order is `Left, Center, Right`; for `Cars` this is `Front, Side, Back`. When combining Left=Front, Center=Side, Right=Back.

3 (AUS, USA, Cars) versions with 6 reps of

| event | duration       |
| ----- | -------------- |
| Fix 1 | 1.5, 7.5, 15   |
| mem L | 3              |
| mem C | 3              |
| mem R | 3              |
| Fix 2 | 4.5, 7.5       |
| TestL | 4.5            |
| Fix 3 | 1.5, 3, 6, 7.5 |
| TestC | 4.5            |
| Fix 4 | 1.5, 4.5, 7.5  |
| TestR | 4.5            |

### recall
There are 30 trials per AUS, USA, cars like Fix+Test. The response window is 4.5 seconds. Fixation is variable. First fixation is 9 seconds. It's followed by 20s of review.

## GLM

### CMFT/Cond1
* `aus`, `cars`, and `usa` (CMFT, cond1) are combined. 
* each `Mem{L,R,C}` set are treated as a single 9 secs event.
* `Test{L,R,C}` are each treated as a single type of 4.5 secs event. But are broken up by accuracy.
  * all together are also available as e.g. `1d/sub-103_ses-1/Test.1d` (c.f `1d/sub-103_ses-1/Test_{crct,err}.1d`)

The 1D files are generated with `03_1dTiming` and the models with `04_deconGLM`.

```bash
1dgrayplot ../glm/102_ses-1/X.1D
```

## TODO
* Find ages and Diagg=="NA"
* QA func w/roi TS
* GLM
   * break up Test events by novel or not (find info in eprime log)
   * add global signal? csf? wm? other regressors?
   * censor previous TR to large motion? kick out high motion people?
   * generate `errts` timeseries from 3dDeconvolve
   * Cond2. Ever analysed? 
* ROI coef extract. Which rois?
* simple 3dttest++ w/ASD vs TD
* datalad (half implemented)
